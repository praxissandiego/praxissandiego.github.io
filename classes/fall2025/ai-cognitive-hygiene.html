            <h2>Course Description</h2>
            <p>
                From fire to writing to social media, technology changes us when adapted and used widely. Large language models (LLMs) and AI tools more broadly are no exception. So how are these technologies influencing us today and how might they influence us in the future? Which of these influences do we want to embrace, and which ones do we want to counteract? And, most importantly, what are the practical strategies and techniques to accomplish that? This is what this class is about.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each class – two hours with a break around midway through the session – we will tackle one or two different questions related to AI, such as:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Do LLMs help you learn and acquire skills? Or do they make you dumber and less creative?</li>
                <li>How often do they hallucinate and what can you do about it? What are their limitations and strengths?</li>
                <li>Should you worry about conversations with LLMs making you psychotic? Or are they a great substitute for a therapist?</li>
                <li>How are AI tools used in scams and how to suss them out?</li>
                <li>What are socioeconomic implications and costs of the increased AI use?</li>
                <li>Is an AI god going to turn us all into paperclips in two years? Or is the hype bubble about to burst and we should focus more on other dangers of AI?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Much remains unknown about LLMs and AI technologies since their widespread adoption is still very recent. We will keep these uncertainties in focus throughout the class. However, even with this in mind, we will discuss and test existing strategies to develop good cognitive hygiene around the use of LLMs and AI.
            </p>
            <p>
                <u>No prerequisites required!</u> You don't need extensive technical knowledge about AI – if you've used LLMs or other AI tools and are curious about the questions above, you're ready to participate. Occasional readings or activities outside of class may be assigned, but won't require more than 30 minutes to complete.
            </p>

            <h2>Your Instructors</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Arthur</strong> has a background in social science research and is deeply interested in how we think in practice, how we can think in principle, and how to extend the ways in which we can think. He has used LLMs extensively in data science work and his research and has been interested in the topic since the release of GPT-2.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Cornel</strong> is fascinated by how science fiction is rapidly becoming our reality, and is hopeful that we can find ourselves in a more positive future than as is depicted in some of the canonical media works in the space. It may not be actual Artificial Intelligence, but it's close enough that we should do all we can to educate ourselves so we can navigate towards that brighter future for ourselves and our community.
